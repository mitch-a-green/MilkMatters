Summary:
--------
The Milk Matters Mobile Application provides breast milk donation and breastfeeding features and content to mothers, and, 
in particular, Milk Matters' donor mothers. The features and functionality provided include: a donation tracker, 
educational content, news and events feed, and "about Milk Matters" section. Registered donor mothers are also able to access a depot locator, 
which provides them with a map of Milk Matters' depots, and key information about each depot.

Milk Matters is a community-based breast milk bank that pasteurises and distributes donations of screened breast milk from 
healthy donors to premature, ill and vulnerable babies whose own mothers cannot supply the breast milk to meet their babyâ€™s needs. 
Milk Matters also facilitates the setting up of milk banks in health institutions.

The Milk Matters Mobile Application has been coded by Mitchell Green and Chelsea Wardle together, using peer-review coding practice.

The Donation Tracker/Logging fragment was coded seperately by Mitchell Green
and the Education fragment was coded seperately by Chelsea Wardle.
However, both were still checked and tested by the other partner before being incorporated into the application.
